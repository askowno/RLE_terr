Tools for undertaking the Red List of Ecosystems Assessment (terrestrial) for the National Biodiversity Assessment 2025. 

1) R terra and sf spatial functions to calculate EOO for vegetation remnants layer - thus avoiding limitations of redlistr package
which struggled to calculate EOO for a remnants later at less than 120m pixel resolution.
2) R tidy functions to include land cover change metrics into Criterion A2b and A3 assessments
3) R terra functions to make use of recent invasive alien tree spatial models (Rebelo et al., 2024) in Criterion D3 assessments
